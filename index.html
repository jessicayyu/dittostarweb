      <h3>What is DittoStar?</h3>  
      <div class="desc">
        DittoStar is a Discord chat bot that links Reddit and Discord, provides moderation tools and automatic moderation actions, and utilizes open-source libraries and APIs to answer user queries regarding game and time zone information right from the chatroom.<br><br>

        It also comes with a slightly snarky personality because life's more fun that way. DittoStar will <em>occasionally</em> comment on whatever you're asking it to do, or say something when a command fails due to an input error.
